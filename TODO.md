#TODO

## General
- add button to run in browser
- Work on README.md

## Fraud Detection
- Compare different machine learning models
- Use AUPRC
- Use a diagonal corr plot

## Building a Neural Network
- make a scatter plot to show artificially created input
- impliment back propagation
- impliment dropout
- impliment leaky ReLU
- show the decision boundries on a graph (can use z axis to show percent)

## Notebook Ideas
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/eeg+database
- eye blink data predition
- eeg epiepsy classification
- Opiod deaths with CDC data
- Education vs Relgion vs Political Preference
- Religion dataset
- Machine learning prediction
- Create a neural network from scratch
